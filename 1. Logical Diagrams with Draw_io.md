## Project Name: Using Draw.io to create structured logical diagrams for network scope, planning and vulnerability testing

## Objective
Learn the basics vectors and tools for creating logical diagrams

### Skills Learned
1. **Understanding Logical Diagrams**: Learn the purpose and structure of logical diagrams, which represent the logical relationships and flow within a system or network.

2. **Using draw.io**: Get familiar with the draw.io interface, a popular diagramming tool that allows users to create a variety of diagrams.

3. **Creating Shapes and Connecting Elements**: Learn how to add and customize shapes, connect elements using lines or arrows, and adjust the layout for clarity.

4. **Labeling and Annotations**: Discover how to add labels, notes, and annotations to clearly describe the components and relationships in the diagram.

5. **Organizing and Aligning**: Learn tips for aligning elements, using grids, and organizing the diagram to ensure itâ€™s visually coherent and easy to understand.

6. **Exporting and Sharing**: Learn how to export your diagram in various formats (e.g., PNG, PDF) for sharing or embedding into other documents or presentations.


### Tools Used
In the video "How To Create a Logical Diagram using draw.io," the following tools are typically used:

1. **draw.io Interface**: The primary tool for creating diagrams, including various shapes, connectors, and grids.

2. **Shape Library**: A collection of pre-built shapes and symbols that can be dragged into the workspace to represent different components of the logical diagram.

3. **Connectors**: Tools to create lines or arrows that link shapes, representing relationships or data flow.

4. **Formatting Tools**: Options to change colors, line styles, text fonts, and sizes to customize the appearance of the diagram elements.

5. **Alignment and Distribution Tools**: Features that help align and distribute shapes evenly within the diagram, making it more organized and visually appealing.

6. **Grid and Snap-to-Grid**: A grid system that helps align elements precisely, ensuring a neat and structured layout.

7. **Export Options**: Tools for exporting the final diagram in different formats like PNG, PDF, SVG, etc., for easy sharing or embedding in other documents.

These tools within draw.io help create clear and professional logical diagrams.
