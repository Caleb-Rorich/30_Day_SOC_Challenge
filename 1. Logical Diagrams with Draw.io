Project Name: Using Draw.io to create structured logical diagrams for network scope, planning and vulnerability testing

## Objective
Learn the basics vectors and tools for creating logical diagrams

### Skills Learned
1. Understanding Logical Diagrams: Learn the purpose and structure of logical diagrams, which represent the logical relationships and flow within a system or network.

2. Using draw.io: Get familiar with the draw.io interface, a popular diagramming tool that allows users to create a variety of diagrams.

3. Creating Shapes and Connecting Elements: Learn how to add and customize shapes, connect elements using lines or arrows, and adjust the layout for clarity.

4. Labeling and Annotations: Discover how to add labels, notes, and annotations to clearly describe the components and relationships in the diagram.

5. Organizing and Aligning: Learn tips for aligning elements, using grids, and organizing the diagram to ensure itâ€™s visually coherent and easy to understand.

6. Exporting and Sharing: Learn how to export your diagram in various formats (e.g., PNG, PDF) for sharing or embedding into other documents or presentations.


### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
